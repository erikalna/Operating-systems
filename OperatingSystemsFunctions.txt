Operating system is kind of the brain of a computer.
It is the manager of the software and hardware used.
Operating system is the mastermind of any computer
It controls base functions of a computer.

WINDOWS OS is the most common operating system
I have used this operating system since I had my first computer
My recent version is Windows 10

I have tried to use MAC OS but it seems more complicated and different
I know it is better for designers
Probably one day I wil change to a MAC.
